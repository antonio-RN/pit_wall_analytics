## Pit Wall Analytics

Created as a Final Master's project, _Pit Wall Analytics_ app is a one-stop-shop for Formula 1 results, 
race & qualifying data, and in-depth analysis. With it you can explore past races and qualifying sessions,
visualize performance with our summarizing graphs, or dive into the details of each
lap and car telemetry.
